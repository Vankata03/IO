Operations research - University

This repository contains coursework for a university class on Operations Research. The code focuses on algorithms related to shortest path problems, including implementations of Bellman's algorithms (such as the Bellman-Ford algorithm). These algorithms are used to solve optimization problems on graphs, commonly encountered in operations research.
